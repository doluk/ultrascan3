# UltraScan III Documentation

## Building Documentation Files

To make the UltraScan III documentation files for Qt Assistant, from the `ultrascan3/doc/manual` directory, simply run:

```bash
make
```

This requires that the Qt5 binaries are in your PATH and the Perl tool `tpage` is available.

### Installing Required Tools

To get `tpage`, check your distribution for `libtemplate-perl` or install it yourself as root:

```bash
sudo cpan -i Template::Tools
```

Reference: http://template-toolkit.org/docs/index.html

On some installations, AppConfig may also be required:

```bash
sudo cpan -i AppConfig
```

For doxygen documentation generation, a program called "GraphViz" is needed. It's available from:
http://www.graphviz.org/Download_source.php

## File Organization

### Important Note on File Structure

During the build process:
- Source `.body` files are organized in directories for ease of maintenance
- The build process flattens this structure, placing all files in a single output directory and then creates the HTML
- Image files maintain their original folder structure under the `images/` directory

Cross-referencing implications:
- When linking to other HTML files, do not include directory paths as they won't exist in the built documentation
- Example correct link: `<b><a href="gmp_define_experiment.html">Define Another Experiment</a></b>`
- Incorrect link: `<a href="gmp/gmp_define_experiment.html">Define Another Experiment</a>`
- For images, continue to include the full path with subdirectories: `<img src="images/gmp/data_acquisition/gmp_data_acquisition_01.png">`

This flattened structure simplifies the build process using a template engine while preserving logical organization in the source files.

## Documentation Style Guidelines

When creating or editing documentation files:

1. Image Formatting
   - Wrap all images in a centered paragraph to prevent large spaces:
     ```html
     <p class="center"><img src="images/example.png" alt="Example"/></p>
     ```
   - Keep image dimensions at 800px or smaller for optimal display across devices
   - Ensure all images have descriptive alt text

2. body Structure
   - Follow the existing template structure with proper inclusion of header and footer elements
   - Use semantic HTML elements appropriately
   - Maintain consistent heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)

3. CSS Usage
   - Use the provided CSS classes rather than inline styles
   - The `center` class is particularly important for properly aligning images
   - Refer to `mainstyle.css` for available styling options

4. Content Guidelines
   - Use consistent formatting for navigation links, examples, and code snippets
   - Keep explanations clear and concise
   - Organize content with appropriate headings and lists
   - Include cross-references to related documentation pages where helpful

## Example Document Structure

```html
[% INCLUDE header.us3/
   title = 'UltraScan III Component Name'
%]

    <h2>Component Name</h2>

    <p>Description of the component and its purpose.</p>

    <p class="center"><img src="images/component.png" alt="Component Description"/></p>

    <h3>Functions:</h3>

    <ul>
       <li>
          <b>Function Name:</b> Description of what this function does.
       </li>
       <!-- Additional functions -->
    </ul>

[% INCLUDE footer.us3 %]
```

## Testing Documentation with Qt Assistant

After building your documentation, it's important to test it with Qt Assistant to ensure proper formatting and functionality:

1. Launch Qt Assistant:
   ```bash
   assistant -collectionFile bin/manual.qhc
   ```

2. Navigation Testing:
   - Verify all links work correctly
   - Check that images display properly
   - Ensure table of contents is complete and accurate
   - Test search functionality with common terms

3. Display Testing:
   - Test documentation at different window sizes
   - Verify that centered images remain properly aligned
   - Check that font sizes and styles are consistent
   - Ensure code examples are properly formatted

4. Content Validation:
   - Verify technical accuracy of all procedures
   - Ensure screenshots match the current software version
   - Check for any broken references or outdated information
